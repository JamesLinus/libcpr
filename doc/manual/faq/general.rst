FAQ: General Questions
======================

This section collects answers to frequently-asked general questions
regarding the ``libcpr`` project.

**Q:** What is ``libcpr``?
--------------------------

**A:** ``libcpr`` is a public domain backport of the core data structures
and algorithms from the C++11 standard library to C.

For more particulars, take a look at the :doc:`../intro` chapter.

**Q:** Why is it named ``libcpr`` instead of something else?
------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** The name has two parallel and congruent origins:

1. The project originally started out being called Câ€² (as in, C-`prime`_),
   with a rather larger scope than presently, before being rebooted back to
   basics.

2. The library could be considered an effort to administer CPR_ to the
   venerable C language.

.. _CPR:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation

**Q:** Which version of the C standard does the library require?
----------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** TODO

.. index:: portability

**Q:** How portable is the library?
-----------------------------------

**A:** The code base is written in standard, clean, and modern C++11, and
should be highly portable to conforming compilers.

.. index:: GCC, Clang

**Q:** Which C/C++ compilers does the library build with?
---------------------------------------------------------

**A:** At present, the library has been successfully built and tested with
the following compilers and platforms:
